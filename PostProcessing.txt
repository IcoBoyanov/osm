Problems:
=========

Broken model:
* Duplicate relationships
* Disconnected ways (first node missing)

Less optimal model:
* No distance calculation on NEXT
* Complex geometries

Duplicate relationships
-----------------------

Custom BadCollector to note duplicate nodes and use this to search for duplicate relationships.

Disconnected ways (first node missing)
--------------------------------------

Custom BadCollector to take note of duplicate ways, and then use that as a set to post-process looking for missing FIRST_NODE
relationships and then searching for OSMWayNode's with same way_osm_id properties, and re-connecting the way.

Taking note of CollectBadRelationships will also help find possible broken ways.

No distance calculation on NEXT
-------------------------------

Post-processing. This can be calculated on demand as part of a query, but will be slow. Better to traverse all ways and fill
in the distance on NEXT and the total distance on way tags or way properties.

Complex geometries
------------------

Post processing.
